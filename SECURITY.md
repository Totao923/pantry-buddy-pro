# Security Guidelines for Pantry Buddy Pro

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities found in the current codebase and provides remediation steps.

## üö® Immediate Security Fixes Required

### 1. API Authentication (CRITICAL)

**Status**: ‚ùå VULNERABLE  
**Issue**: All API endpoints currently lack authentication

**Current vulnerable endpoints**:

- `/api/ingredients/*` - No authentication required
- `/api/recipes/*` - No authentication required
- `/api/database/*` - No authentication required

**Fix implemented**: See `/pages/api/secure/ingredients.ts` for secure example

**Required actions**:

```bash
# Apply authentication middleware to all API endpoints
# Example for /pages/api/ingredients/index.ts:

import { withAuth } from '../../lib/middleware/auth';
import { withSecurity } from '../../lib/middleware/security';

export default withSecurity()(withAuth(handler));
```

### 2. Service Role Key Exposure (HIGH)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED  
**Issue**: Service role key accessible in browser environment

**Fix applied**: Added client-side prevention in `/lib/supabase/client.ts`

**Still required**:

- Audit all API endpoints to use user-scoped clients instead of service role
- Move service role operations to dedicated server-only middleware

### 3. Input Validation (MEDIUM)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY FIXED  
**Issue**: Insufficient input validation and sanitization

**Fix implemented**: Created validation schemas in `/lib/validation/schemas.ts`

**Required integration**:

```typescript
import { validateAndSanitize, CreateIngredientSchema } from '../lib/validation/schemas';

// In API handler:
const validatedData = validateAndSanitize(CreateIngredientSchema, req.body);
```

## üîê Security Middleware Implemented

### Authentication Middleware (`/lib/middleware/auth.ts`)

- JWT token validation
- User information extraction
- Role-based authorization
- Error handling with security codes

### Security Middleware (`/lib/middleware/security.ts`)

- Rate limiting (in-memory, upgrade to Redis for production)
- CORS protection
- Security headers
- Content-Type validation
- CSRF protection (basic implementation)
- Request size limiting

### Input Validation (`/lib/validation/schemas.ts`)

- Zod-based validation schemas
- Regex pattern matching for safe inputs
- Size and format limitations
- Sanitization helpers

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Headers Applied

Via `next.config.js`:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Permissions Policy

## üìã Security Checklist

### Immediate Actions (Critical - Complete within 24 hours)

- [ ] Apply authentication middleware to all API endpoints
- [ ] Audit and fix service role key usage
- [ ] Add input validation to all API endpoints
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end

### High Priority (Complete within 1 week)

- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Set up security logging and monitoring
- [ ] Audit all dependencies for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement rate limiting with Redis

### Medium Priority (Complete within 2 weeks)

- [ ] Add request/response logging for audit trails
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Add security tests to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Review and tighten CSP policies

### Ongoing Security Practices

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Monthly security audits
- [ ] Penetration testing (quarterly)
- [ ] Security awareness training
- [ ] Incident response plan

## üîç Security Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

```bash
# Test authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/ingredients
# Should return 401 Unauthorized

# Test input validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/secure/ingredients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>"}'
# Should return validation error

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..150}; do
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/secure/ingredients \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
done
# Should return 429 Too Many Requests after limit
```

### Automated Security Testing

```bash
# Install security testing tools
npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Run security tests
npm run test:security  # Add this script
npm run build && npm run analyze  # Bundle analysis
```

## üö® Incident Response

If a security vulnerability is discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Disable affected endpoints
2. **Within 1 hour**: Assess impact and create fix
3. **Within 4 hours**: Deploy fix to production
4. **Within 24 hours**: Conduct post-incident review
5. **Within 1 week**: Update security measures to prevent recurrence

## üìû Security Contacts

- **Security Lead**: [Your Security Team]
- **Emergency Contact**: [Emergency Security Contact]
- **Vulnerability Reports**: security@yourcompany.com

## üîÑ Regular Security Updates

This security document should be reviewed and updated:

- After any major code changes
- Monthly security reviews
- After any security incidents
- Quarterly comprehensive audits

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER

**The current codebase has critical security vulnerabilities that make it unsuitable for production deployment until the fixes outlined above are implemented.**

**Priority Level**: CRITICAL - Immediate action required

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - Potential for complete data compromise

**Recommendation**: Do not deploy to production until all critical and high-priority security issues are resolved.
