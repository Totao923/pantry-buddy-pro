# Receipt Deletion Fix

## Problem Analysis

User reported: "the app is failing to delete the receipts"

### Investigation Findings

1. **API Exists**: `/api/delete-all-receipts.ts` is implemented
2. **Frontend Integration**: Called from `pantry.tsx:609`
3. **Authentication**: API correctly uses authenticated user ID (fixed from previous hardcoded version)
4. **Method**: Uses POST method with proper error handling

### Root Cause Investigation Needed

- [ ] Check frontend fetch implementation in pantry.tsx
- [ ] Verify authentication headers are being sent
- [ ] Check browser network tab for actual error response
- [ ] Test API endpoint directly
- [ ] Check Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Verify user permissions on receipts table

## Plan

1. Read pantry.tsx delete function implementation
2. Check for authentication issues in the fetch request
3. Test the API endpoint directly
4. Fix any identified issues
5. Verify the fix works

## Success Criteria

- Delete receipts button successfully removes all receipts
- User sees success message
- Receipts are permanently deleted from database
- No errors in console or network tab
