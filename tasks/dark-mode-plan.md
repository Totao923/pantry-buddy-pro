# Dark Mode Implementation Plan

## Problem

User wants to implement a dark mode toggle button in the settings page to allow users to switch between light and dark themes.

## Current Status

- ❌ No dark mode support in the application
- ❌ No dark mode toggle in settings
- ❌ No theme context or state management

## Plan

### 1. Check existing settings page structure

- Find the settings page component
- Understand current settings layout
- Identify where to place dark mode toggle

### 2. Implement simple dark mode toggle

- Add dark mode state management (localStorage + React state)
- Create toggle button component for settings
- Use Tailwind's `dark:` classes for basic theming

### 3. Apply dark mode to key components

- Start with settings page itself
- Apply to main layout components
- Focus on core user interface elements

### 4. Test dark mode functionality

- Ensure toggle works properly
- Verify dark mode persists on page reload
- Check that styling looks good in both modes

## Implementation Approach (Simple & Focused)

- **Theme Management**: Use React state + localStorage (simple approach)
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind's built-in dark mode classes
- **Scope**: Start with settings page and main layout
- **UI Pattern**: Toggle switch in settings page

## Files to modify:

- `pages/dashboard/settings.tsx` - Add dark mode toggle
- Key layout components for theming
- Potentially create a simple theme context

## Safety measures:

- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Don't break existing styling
- Make dark mode optional (defaults to light)
- Test functionality thoroughly
