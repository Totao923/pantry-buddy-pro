# Performance Optimization Plan

Based on analysis of the Pantry Buddy Pro codebase, here are the identified performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities:

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### 1. **Repeated Data Loading**

- Multiple pages call `getAllIngredients()` independently
- Analytics dashboard makes 7+ parallel API calls on every load
- AI Nutritionist component loads data every time it renders
- No shared cache between components

### 2. **Heavy Component Loading**

- Analytics page loads large charts library (Recharts) synchronously
- AI Nutritionist performs API calls on every render
- Some dashboard pages don't use dynamic imports

### 3. **Inefficient useEffect Dependencies**

- Analytics reloads all data when timeRange changes
- Some components reload data unnecessarily
- Missing dependency optimization

### 4. **Bundle Size Issues**

- Chart libraries loaded even when not needed
- Services imported synchronously in multiple places

## Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: Data Loading Optimization (Simple Changes)

**Todo 1: Implement Global Ingredients Cache**

- Create a React Context for ingredients data
- Share ingredients across all components
- Prevent multiple `getAllIngredients()` calls

**Todo 2: Add Memoization to Heavy Components**

- Add `React.memo` to chart components
- Memoize expensive calculations in analytics
- Use `useMemo` for derived data

**Todo 3: Optimize useEffect Dependencies**

- Fix analytics timeRange dependency issue
- Add proper dependency arrays
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Phase 2: Component Loading Optimization (Medium Changes)

**Todo 4: Add More Dynamic Imports**

- Make analytics charts load dynamically
- Add loading states for heavy components
- Implement component-level code splitting

**Todo 5: Implement Component-Level Caching**

- Cache AI Nutritionist results
- Add localStorage caching for analytics data
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern

**Todo 6: Reduce Bundle Size**

- Lazy load chart libraries
- Split vendor bundles
- Remove unused imports

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Complex Changes)

**Todo 7: Implement React Query/SWR**

- Replace manual caching with React Query
- Add background refetching
- Implement optimistic updates

**Todo 8: Add Service Workers**

- Cache API responses
- Implement offline functionality
- Add background sync

## Success Metrics

- Reduce initial page load time by 30%
- Decrease Time to Interactive (TTI) by 25%
- Eliminate duplicate API calls
- Improve user experience with better loading states

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Phase 1)**: Simple changes with biggest impact
**Medium Priority (Phase 2)**: Moderate complexity, good ROI
**Low Priority (Phase 3)**: Complex changes, future improvements

## Next Steps

1. Get user approval for this plan
2. Start with Phase 1 optimizations
3. Test performance improvements after each phase
4. Monitor bundle size and loading times
