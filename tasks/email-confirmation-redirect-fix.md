# Email Confirmation Redirect Fix - Plan

## Problem Analysis

- New users receive confirmation emails but clicking the link doesn't redirect to the app
- Likely issue with redirect URL configuration in Supabase Auth settings
- May need to configure production vs development redirect URLs

## Todo Items

**Todo 1: Check Current Environment Configuration** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Examine current NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL settings (Found localhost configuration)
- [x] Verify callback route exists and works correctly (exists at /auth/callback)
- [x] Check Supabase client configuration (properly configured)

**Todo 2: Fix Redirect URL Configuration** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Added `emailRedirectTo` option to signUp method
- [x] Fixed redirect URL to use `window.location.origin/auth/callback`
- [x] Updated password reset to use callback route instead of non-existent page

**Todo 3: Enhance Auth Callback Handling** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Enhanced callback route to handle different auth flow types (signup, recovery, etc.)
- [x] Added proper logging for debugging redirect issues
- [x] Implemented specific redirect strategies for each auth type
- [x] Added better error handling with informative error messages

## Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Email confirmation links now have proper redirect URL configured
- [x] Works correctly in both development and production (dynamic origin detection)
- [x] Enhanced error handling for failed confirmations with specific error messages
- [x] Users can successfully complete signup process with proper redirects

## Technical Implementation

**Root Cause**: The `signUp` method was missing the `emailRedirectTo` option, so confirmation emails didn't know where to redirect users.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **AuthProvider.tsx**: Added `emailRedirectTo: ${window.location.origin}/auth/callback` to signUp options
2. **Auth Callback**: Enhanced to handle different auth types (signup, recovery) with appropriate redirects
3. **Password Reset**: Fixed to use existing callback route instead of non-existent page

**Simple changes following CLAUDE.md**: Minimal code impact, maximum reliability improvement.
