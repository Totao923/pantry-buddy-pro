# Data Migration Audit: localStorage to Supabase

## Objective

Ensure all app data is loading from Supabase instead of localStorage to provide users with actual, persistent data across recipe creation, pantry entries, receipts, and analytics.

## Plan Overview

Following CLAUDE.md principles: simple, minimal changes that build on existing infrastructure.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Discovery & Assessment

- [ ] 1.1 Find all localStorage usage patterns across codebase
- [ ] 1.2 Audit existing Supabase service integration status
- [ ] 1.3 Analyze context providers for data source inconsistencies
- [ ] 1.4 Check component data flow patterns
- [ ] 1.5 Create priority matrix for migrations

### Phase 2: Critical Data Sources (High Priority)

- [ ] 2.1 Recipe management data loading (creation, saving, deletion)
- [ ] 2.2 Pantry entries data persistence (IngredientsProvider)
- [ ] 2.3 Receipt processing and storage
- [ ] 2.4 User authentication and session data

### Phase 3: Analytics & Preferences (Medium Priority)

- [ ] 3.1 Analytics dashboard data sources (already completed)
- [ ] 3.2 User preferences and settings
- [ ] 3.3 Meal planning data storage
- [ ] 3.4 Usage tracking data

### Phase 4: Secondary Features (Low Priority)

- [ ] 4.1 UI state and temporary data
- [ ] 4.2 Cache and performance optimizations
- [ ] 4.3 Offline capability considerations

### Phase 5: Validation & Testing

- [ ] 5.1 Test data persistence across browser sessions
- [ ] 5.2 Verify cross-device data synchronization
- [ ] 5.3 Confirm no data loss during migration
- [ ] 5.4 Performance impact assessment

## Success Criteria

- All persistent user data stored in Supabase
- No critical localStorage dependencies
- Data synchronizes across devices/sessions
- No performance degradation
- Simple, minimal code changes

## Risk Mitigation

- Preserve existing localStorage as fallback during transition
- Incremental migration (one data type at a time)
- Extensive testing before removing localStorage
- Rollback plan for each migration

## Discovery Results

### ‚úÖ Services Already Using Supabase

- **IngredientsProvider** - Uses smart service factory (Supabase + localStorage fallback)
- **CookingSessionService** - Full Supabase integration
- **UsageTrackingService** - Full Supabase integration
- **ReceiptService** - Hybrid Supabase + localStorage
- **DatabaseRecipeService** - Full Supabase integration
- **MealPlanService** - Full Supabase integration

### ‚ùå Critical localStorage Dependencies Found

1. **Recipe Management** (83 instances)
   - `/pages/dashboard/recipes.tsx` - favorites, deleted recipes
   - `/pages/dashboard/recipe/[id].tsx` - ratings, reviews, saving
   - `/pages/dashboard/create-recipe.tsx` - recent recipes, user recipes
   - `/lib/services/recipeService.ts` - mixed localStorage + Supabase

2. **Legacy Components** (15 instances)
   - `/pages/index.tsx` - pantry inventory, ratings, reviews
   - Main landing page still using localStorage

3. **Shopping Lists** (8 instances)
   - `/pages/dashboard/shopping-lists.tsx` - all shopping list data
   - `/lib/services/shoppingListService.ts` - localStorage only

4. **Settings & Preferences** (5 instances)
   - `/lib/contexts/HealthGoalContext.tsx` - health goals
   - Auth reset attempts tracking

### Migration Priority Matrix

#### üî• **CRITICAL (Immediate)**

1. **Recipe Favorites & Ratings** - Users lose data across sessions
2. **Shopping Lists** - Core feature not persisting
3. **Recipe Service Cleanup** - Mixed localStorage/Supabase causing data inconsistency

#### üü° **HIGH (This Phase)**

4. **Main Landing Page** - Legacy localStorage usage
5. **Health Goals Context** - User preferences lost

#### üü¢ **MEDIUM (Next Phase)**

6. **Cache & Temporary Data** - Performance optimization
7. **Barcode History** - Convenience feature
8. **Analytics Cache** - Already completed migration

#### ‚ö™ **LOW (Future)**

9. **Migration Utilities** - Cleanup old migration code
10. **Test Files** - Development/testing localStorage usage

## ‚úÖ Completed Migrations Review

### Shopping Lists Migration (September 17, 2025)

**Objective**: Migrate shopping lists from localStorage to Supabase to ensure data persistence across devices and sessions.

**Changes Made**:

1. **Enhanced `lib/services/shoppingListService.ts`**:
   - Added Supabase authentication utilities (`ensureAuthenticated`, `isAuthenticated`)
   - Added Supabase CRUD methods (`getShoppingListsFromSupabase`, `saveShoppingListToSupabase`)
   - Updated all public methods to be async and use Supabase with localStorage fallback:
     - `getAllShoppingLists()` ‚Üí `async getAllShoppingLists()`
     - `getActiveShoppingList()` ‚Üí `async getActiveShoppingList()`
     - `createShoppingList()` ‚Üí `async createShoppingList()`
     - `addItemToList()` ‚Üí `async addItemToList()`
     - `addItemToActiveList()` ‚Üí `async addItemToActiveList()`
   - Preserved original localStorage methods as `addItemToListLocalStorage()` for fallback

2. **Updated `components/AInutritionist.tsx`**:
   - Added `await` to `ShoppingListService.addItemToActiveList(newItem)` call
   - Function was already async, minimal change required

**Architecture**:

- Uses existing `shopping_lists` and `shopping_list_items` database tables
- Implements authentication-aware data loading with graceful localStorage fallback
- Follows established pattern from Recipe Favorites migration
- Maintains backward compatibility for unauthenticated users

**Database Schema**:

- No additional SQL migrations required
- Uses existing tables from `001_initial_schema.sql` and `009_account_deletion_missing_tables.sql`

**Benefits**:

- ‚úÖ Shopping lists now persist across browser sessions for authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Data synchronizes across devices when signed in
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to localStorage for unauthenticated users
- ‚úÖ Minimal code changes following CLAUDE.md principles
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

**Testing**:

## üö® RESOLVED: Family Tier Live Products Missing

**Issue Found**: While testing, I discovered that the family tier products exist in test mode but are MISSING from live mode.

**Current Live Products**:

- ‚úÖ Premium: `prod_T2nQpaTUr1gcn1` with monthly ($9.99) and yearly ($95.88) prices
- ‚ùå Family: **NOT FOUND** in live mode
- ‚ùå Chef: **NOT FOUND** in live mode

### Required Action: Create Family Tier in Stripe Dashboard

**API Key Permission Issue Confirmed**: The current live API key (`rk_live_*****oGTHog`) is a restricted key that lacks product creation permissions. The CLI works fine in test mode but fails in live mode.

**Explanation**: You're absolutely right that the premium tier was created via CLI before. The API key permissions appear to have been restricted after the premium tier creation, likely for security reasons.

Since the Stripe CLI doesn't have live product creation permissions, you need to create the family tier manually in the Stripe Dashboard:

#### Step 1: Create Family Tier Product

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products)
2. Click **"+ Add product"**
3. **Product Details**:
   - **Name**: `Pantry Buddy Family`
   - **Description**: `Everything in Premium, plus family sharing for up to 6 members`
   - **Type**: `Service`

#### Step 2: Create Family Tier Pricing (Match Premium Format)

**Monthly Price**:

- **Price**: `$19.99`
- **Billing**: `Monthly`
- **Currency**: `USD`
- **Type**: `Recurring`

**Yearly Price** (20% discount):

- **Price**: `$191.76`
- **Billing**: `Yearly`
- **Currency**: `USD`
- **Type**: `Recurring`

#### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

After creating the products, copy the price IDs and update `.env.local`:

```bash
STRIPE_FAMILY_MONTHLY_PRICE_ID=price_[new_monthly_id]
STRIPE_FAMILY_YEARLY_PRICE_ID=price_[new_yearly_id]
```

#### Step 4: Verification

- Family tier will appear in your Products catalog
- Pricing matches Premium tier format
- App will be able to create family tier subscriptions
