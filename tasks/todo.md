# BULK RECIPE DELETION FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## Problem Analysis

**User Request:** Add functionality to select multiple recipes and delete them in bulk from the My Recipes page.

**Current State:**

- ‚úÖ Individual recipe deletion exists with `deleteRecipe(recipeId)` function
- ‚úÖ Recipe grid and list view display modes
- ‚úÖ Recipe cards have individual delete buttons (üóëÔ∏è)
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Bulk selection functionality
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Bulk delete operations

**Benefits:**

- Improved user experience for managing large recipe collections
- Faster cleanup of unwanted recipes
- Common pattern users expect in content management interfaces

## Implementation Plan (Following CLAUDE.md - Simple & Minimal)

### Phase 1: Add Selection Mode

**Target:** Add the ability to select multiple recipes with checkboxes

**Changes Required:**

1. **Add selection state management**
   - `selectedRecipes: string[]` state
   - `isSelectionMode: boolean` state
   - `toggleSelection()` function
   - `selectAll()` function

2. **Add selection UI elements**
   - "Select" button to enter selection mode
   - Checkboxes on recipe cards (only visible in selection mode)
   - "Select All" / "Clear All" buttons
   - Cancel selection mode button

### Phase 2: Add Bulk Delete Functionality

**Target:** Enable deletion of selected recipes

**Changes Required:**

1. **Add bulk delete function**
   - `bulkDeleteRecipes(recipeIds: string[])` function
   - Confirmation dialog showing count of selected recipes
   - Progress feedback during bulk operations

2. **Add bulk action UI**
   - "Delete Selected" button (only visible when recipes are selected)
   - Selected count display
   - Bulk action bar

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify:

- `pages/dashboard/recipes.tsx` (single file changes only)

### UI Flow:

1. User clicks "Select" button ‚Üí enters selection mode
2. Recipe cards show checkboxes ‚Üí user checks desired recipes
3. "Delete Selected (X)" button appears ‚Üí shows count
4. User clicks delete ‚Üí confirmation dialog
5. Bulk delete executes ‚Üí updates UI ‚Üí exits selection mode

### State Management:

```typescript
const [selectedRecipes, setSelectedRecipes] = useState<string[]>([]);
const [isSelectionMode, setIsSelectionMode] = useState(false);
```

### Key Functions:

- `toggleSelectionMode()` - Enter/exit selection mode
- `toggleRecipeSelection(recipeId: string)` - Select/deselect individual recipe
- `selectAllRecipes()` - Select all visible recipes
- `bulkDeleteRecipes(recipeIds: string[])` - Delete multiple recipes

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Selection Mode** (Simple UI additions)

1. Add selection state variables
2. Add "Select" button to header
3. Add checkboxes to recipe cards (conditional rendering)
4. Add select all/clear functionality

**Phase 2: Bulk Delete** (Extend existing delete functionality)

1. Create bulk delete function using existing `deleteRecipe` logic
2. Add bulk action bar with delete button
3. Add confirmation dialog for bulk operations
4. Add success/error feedback

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Selection Mode Working:** Users can enter selection mode and select multiple recipes  
‚úÖ **Bulk Delete Working:** Users can delete multiple selected recipes at once  
‚úÖ **Error Handling:** Proper confirmation dialogs and error feedback  
‚úÖ **UI/UX:** Intuitive interface that follows existing design patterns  
‚úÖ **Performance:** Fast operations even with many recipes selected

### Implementation Summary

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:** Bulk Recipe Deletion Feature successfully implemented following the planned approach.

### Changes Made

**1. Selection State Management** (`pages/dashboard/recipes.tsx:30-31`)

- Added `selectedRecipes: string[]` state to track selected recipe IDs
- Added `isSelectionMode: boolean` state to control selection UI visibility

- Added conditional checkboxes to both grid and list view modes
- Checkboxes only appear when `isSelectionMode` is true
- Visual feedback: selected cards get blue ring and background highlighting
- Toggle functionality updates `selectedRecipes` state appropriately

**4. Bulk Delete Function** (`pages/dashboard/recipes.tsx:280-351`)
