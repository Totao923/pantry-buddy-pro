# Safe Analytics Page Removal Plan

## Problem

We need to safely remove the analytics page from the sidebar navigation since analytics functionality has been moved to the overview page. We must ensure this doesn't break the app.

## Current Status

- ✅ Already removed Analytics from sidebar navigation in DashboardLayout.tsx
- ❌ Need to verify this change doesn't break anything
- ❌ Need to check if analytics page route still exists and works
- ❌ Need to test the app still functions properly

## Plan

### 1. Test current app functionality

- Check that sidebar renders properly without Analytics
- Verify navigation still works for all other pages
- Test that removing Analytics doesn't cause any React errors

### 2. Verify analytics route handling

- Check if `/dashboard/analytics` route still exists
- Ensure users who bookmark the analytics page don't get 404s
- Consider if we need a redirect from analytics to overview

### 3. Check for any references to analytics page

- Search codebase for any hardcoded links to `/dashboard/analytics`
- Look for any components that might reference the analytics route
- Ensure no broken internal links

### 4. Safe deployment approach

- Only commit the sidebar change if no issues found
- Keep the analytics page file for now (don't delete it)
- Test thoroughly before pushing to GitHub

## Files to check:

- `components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx` - Already modified (sidebar navigation)
- `pages/dashboard/analytics.tsx` - Keep file, just not linked in sidebar
- Any other components that might link to analytics

## Safety measures:

- Don't delete the analytics page file itself
- Just remove from navigation
- Test app functionality thoroughly
- Users can still access via direct URL if needed
