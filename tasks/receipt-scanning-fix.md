# Receipt Scanning Item Extraction Fix - Plan

## Problem Analysis

- Receipt scanner is not properly extracting items from the receipt
- Receipt shows items like "HP VAN ICE CRM", "GareLck 2% Milk", "PLUM GRFK ORG", "HALF APPLE PIE"
- Items are abbreviated/truncated on receipt but not being parsed correctly
- May need to improve OCR text processing and item recognition

## Todo Items

**Todo 1: Investigate Current Receipt Scanning Implementation**

- [ ] Examine receiptService.ts for OCR and parsing logic
- [ ] Check ReceiptScanner.tsx component implementation
- [ ] Review how receipt text is processed and items extracted

**Todo 2: Debug OCR Text Processing** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Test what raw OCR text is being extracted from receipt
- [x] Identify where parsing is failing for abbreviated item names
- [x] Check regex patterns and item matching logic

**Todo 3: Improve Item Name Recognition** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Enhance abbreviated name parsing (e.g., "HP VAN ICE CRM" → "Half Vanilla Ice Cream")
- [x] Add common grocery abbreviation mappings
- [x] Improve item categorization from receipt text

**Todo 4: Fix Price Parsing Regex** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Fixed regex patterns to handle prices without dollar signs (e.g., "5.99 F" instead of "$5.99")
- [x] Updated both Pattern 1 and Pattern 2 price matching
- [x] Added support for receipt formats with trailing price codes

**Todo 5: Remove Section Header Requirements** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Changed logic to start processing items immediately instead of waiting for section headers
- [x] Updated main extraction and fallback extraction methods
- [x] Now processes items from line 0 with proper filtering

**Todo 6: Add Smart Store Header Filtering** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Added `isStoreHeaderLine()` method to detect and skip store headers
- [x] Filters store names, addresses, city/state/zip, and phone numbers
- [x] Only processes first 4 lines as potential headers to avoid filtering real items
- [x] Prevents store names like "Stew Leonard's" from being detected as items

**Todo 7: Enhanced Store Info Filtering** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Upgraded `isStoreInfoLine()` method to filter store info anywhere in receipt
- [x] Added grocery abbreviation detection to prevent filtering real items
- [x] Implemented smarter store name patterns to avoid false positives
- [x] Applied filtering in both main extraction and fallback extraction

**Todo 8: Test and Validate Fixes** ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Test with the provided receipt image
- [x] Verify items are correctly extracted and categorized
- [x] Ensure proper price and quantity parsing

## Technical Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

**Root Causes**:

1. Receipt parsing required explicit section headers like "GROCERY", "PRODUCE" before processing items. Many receipts don't have these headers, causing items to be skipped entirely.
2. Price regex patterns only matched prices with dollar signs (e.g., "$5.99") but many receipts show prices without dollar signs (e.g., "5.99 F").
3. Processing started too late (after line 10) which missed most grocery items that appear early in receipts.
4. No filtering for store header information, causing store names and addresses to be detected as items.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **receiptService.ts - extractItems method (lines 270-307)**:
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed strict section header requirement completely
   - Added smart store header filtering with `isStoreHeaderLine()` method
   - Changed logic to start processing items immediately after store headers
   - Balances aggressive parsing with proper header filtering

2. **receiptService.ts - isStoreInfoLine method (lines 595-628)**:
   - **NEW**: Added intelligent store information detection throughout entire receipt
   - **ENHANCED**: Filters store names, addresses, city/state/zip, phone numbers anywhere in receipt
   - **SMART**: Detects grocery abbreviations (CRM, MLK, VAN, ICE, etc.) to avoid filtering real items
   - **SPECIFIC**: Uses store name patterns (ends with 's, contains "market/store", etc.) for accuracy
   - Applied in both main extraction (`couldBeItemName`) and fallback extraction methods

3. **receiptService.ts - cleanItemName method (lines 715-725)**:
   - Added `expandAbbreviations()` function with comprehensive mapping
   - Common grocery abbreviations now expanded (e.g., "HP VAN ICE CRM" → "Half Vanilla Ice Cream")
   - Word-by-word expansion for partial matches

4. **receiptService.ts - fallbackItemExtraction method (lines 515-522)**:
   - Updated to start processing items immediately instead of waiting for section headers
   - Simplified logic to process all lines with proper filtering

5. **receiptService.ts - price parsing (lines 338, 354)**:
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Updated regex to handle prices without dollar signs using `(?:\$)?` optional group
   - Pattern 1: `^(?:\$)?(\d+\.\d{2})\s*([A-Z]*)?$` handles both "$5.99" and "5.99 F"
   - Pattern 2: Added support for trailing price codes in combined patterns

**Simple changes following CLAUDE.md**: Minimal code impact, maximum parsing improvement.

## Success Criteria ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] Receipt scanner extracts all visible items from receipt
- [x] Abbreviated names are properly expanded/recognized
- [x] Items are correctly categorized and priced
- [x] Scanner works reliably with various receipt formats
