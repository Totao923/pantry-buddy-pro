## Combination Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Overview Page Structure

Transform the overview page into a comprehensive dashboard with expandable sections:

```
1. Welcome Section (keep existing)
2. Enhanced Quick Stats Grid (merge basic + analytics stats)
3. Quick Actions (keep existing)
4. Analytics Tabs Section (add from analytics page)
   - Overview Analytics
   - Spending Analytics
   - Pantry Insights
   - Cooking Analytics
5. AI Nutritionist (keep existing, Premium)
6. Recent Activity Summary (consolidate recent recipes + cooking history)
7. Upcoming Features (keep existing)
```

### 2. Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Import Analytics Components

- Import all analytics components and utilities from analytics.tsx
- Import dynamic chart components (Area, Pie, Bar charts)
- Import SpendingAnalytics component
- Import analytics data loading logic

#### Phase 2: Merge Data Loading

- Combine the analytics data loading useEffect with existing dashboard data loading
- Merge analytics state management with existing dashboard state
- Optimize to avoid duplicate API calls

#### Phase 3: Create Enhanced Stats Grid

- Expand from 4 stats to 6-8 key metrics
- Include: Ingredients, Recipes, Cooked Today, Total Spent, Pantry Value, Cooking Streak
- Keep the existing card design but add more metrics

#### Phase 4: Add Analytics Tabs Section

- Add the tabbed interface from analytics page after quick actions
- Make it collapsible/expandable to reduce initial page load
- Include all 4 tabs: Overview, Spending, Pantry, Cooking

#### Phase 5: Simplify Recent Activity

- Combine recent recipes and cooking history into one section
- Show 3 recent recipes + 3 recent cooking sessions
- Add "View All" links to dedicated pages

### 3. Components to Integrate

#### From Analytics Page:

- `DynamicAreaChart` - Weekly recipe activity
- `DynamicPieChart` - Cuisine distribution
- `DynamicBarChart` - Category breakdown
- `SpendingAnalytics` - Complete spending analysis
- Analytics data loading logic
- Receipt integration
- Advanced cooking metrics

#### Keep from Overview Page:

- `QuickSuggestionsAnalytics`
- `CookingStats`
- `CookingHistory`
- `AInutritionistComponent`
- Welcome section
- Quick actions grid

### 4. Data Optimization

- Combine all API calls into single data loading function
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement proper loading states for each section
- Cache analytics data appropriately

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

- Make analytics section collapsible by default
- Add smooth transitions between tabs
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Maintain consistent styling with existing design system

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Single overview page contains all functionality from both pages

3. ✅ Maintains performance (fast initial load)
4. ✅ Analytics features are easily discoverable but not overwhelming
5. ✅ Mobile responsive design
6. ✅ Consistent with existing design system
7. ✅ User can access all analytics without navigation to separate page

## Risk Mitigation

- Keep analytics.tsx file until user approves combined page
- Test thoroughly before deletion
- Ensure all dynamic imports work correctly
- Validate chart performance on mobile devices
- Test with both real and synthetic data

## Implementation Order

1. Import analytics components into dashboard.tsx
2. Merge data loading logic
3. Create enhanced stats grid
4. Add analytics tabs section
5. Test functionality thoroughly
6. Get user approval
7. Delete analytics.tsx only after approval
